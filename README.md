Note: There is no starter for this practice. You will create your own files.

In a new file create a parent class of Computer. Constructor should take in brand, OS, and type parameters. Create an instance method 
called powerOn that logs the message {brand} {type} powers on with {OS}. Create a static method that takes in an array of computer 
instances and calls the powerOn method on each. Create 2 instances of the Computer class. Perform local tests to verify the methods 
behave as expected. Submit a link to the repo with your code.
